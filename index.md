title: Flow-based programming
---

flowbased.org is the home page of the community working on
[Flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) (FBP),
a programming paradigm based on message-passing through a network of black-box processes.

There exists a wide range of FBP and FBP-like runtime implementations.
The goal of the community is to collaborate so that developers and users of the different runtimes
can share tools and best-practices.

We do this by working on resources for understanding FBP programming,
specifications which ensures compatibility between the various implementations,
and tools built against these shared specificiations.

Most of the tools is [on github](https://github.com/flowbased),
and resources can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/flowbased/flowbased.org/wiki).

The primary discussion forum is the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flow-based-programming) (google group).
