title: Welcome to flow-based programming
---

flowbased.org is the home page of the community working on [Flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming),
a programming paradigm based message-passing through a network of black-box processes.

The primary discussion forum is the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flow-based-programming) (google group).

There exists a wide range of FBP and FBP-like runtime implementations, and we try to share best-practices and tools by working
on resources for , and specifications which ensures compatibility between the various implementations.

Most of the [shared tools on github](https://github.com/flowbased/repositories), and more resources can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/flowbased/flowbased.org/wiki).
